# BAbySH
This is a very small and somewhat fast Linux shell. You can help make it smaller and faster.

Rules:
1) No new functions
2) No new features
3) No global variables
3) Any changes must either reduce the number of lines of code while maintaining speed OR increase speed without adding lines of code.

Thanks for the help!
