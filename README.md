This is a tiny and adequately fast Linux shell. With your generous help it could be smaller and (ideally) faster.

"Faster" does not specifically refer to performance measured by standard benchmarks. I am rather referring to low level tricks that may save some clock cycles. If you are making one of those improvements, it will be obvious in the PR.

"Smaller" simply refers to the number of lines of code. This was as terse as I could get it but, again, I know there are some tricks that may shave off a few lines here and there.


Let's turn this into a game and have some fun!


**GAME RULES:**
1) No new functions
2) No new features
3) No global variables
3) Any change must either reduce the number of lines of code while maintaining speed OR increase speed without adding lines of code.


Thanks for the help!!!
