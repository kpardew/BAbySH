# BAbySH
This is a very small and somewhat fast Linux shell. You can help make it smaller and faster. I am not using the word faster to refer to something that is measurable by standard benchmarks. I'm referring to the low level tricks that can help save clock cycles. If you are making one of these improvements, it will be obvious in the PR. I am using the word smaller to simply refer to lines of code. This was as terse as I could get it but, again, I know there are some tricks I don't know about that will shave off a few lines at a time.

**Rules:**
1) No new functions
2) No new features
3) No global variables
3) Any change must either reduce the number of lines of code while maintaining speed OR increase speed without adding lines of code.

Thanks for the help!
